Jute grows efficiently, reducing land use, with little water and no chemicals. Resilient to wear and tear, jute lengthens the product life cycle and reduces waste. The Jacksons partners with women in Bangladesh to hand-make each bag, and every artisan receives access to fair, direct pay, education, and healthcare in exchange.

This Repurposed Denim Squeaky Pet Toy is part of The Foggy Dog's Upcycled Denim collection. For this collection, they partnered with The New Denim Project, a family-operated Guatemalan textile mill that rescues fabrics from nearby factories that would otherwise go to waste and turns them into something new using a chemical and dye-free process that requires very little water and power. This collection has conserved 320 million liters of water, prevented the release of 3,300 pounds of toxic chemicals, and avoided 32,000 pounds of carbon dioxide output. Each toy is stuffed with Sustainafill™, an eco-friendly fiber made from recycled plastic bottles. While a dog toy is almost never indestructible, Foggy Dog is given high praise on durability, and they use heavy-duty squeakers that keep going even when punctured.",
