        "description": "Shop sustainably and support local artisans. Village Thrive embodies the Boon mindset by offering sustainable, natural products handmade by Balinese craftspeople. The Eco-friendly Round Rattan Backpack looks natural and supports the health of our planet. Rattan is incredibly sustainable, it's the fastest-growing tropical wood and preserves the rainforest's natural balance while converting carbon dioxide to oxygen. The techniques used to turn raw rattan wood into furniture and accessories have been passed down for generations, relying on handicraft rather than pollution-heavy manufacturing processes. Rattan's strength and resiliency will hold up well to normal wear and tear, reducing waste by lengthening the life of your bag. Each bag features an iron button closure and is lined in batik print fabric.",

The San Francisco-based company is committed to stylish, durable dog accessories with their American-made products, and they share Boon Market's passion for giving back—they donate a half pound of dog food to animal shelters with every purchase. This Repurposed Denim Squeaky Pet Toy is part of The Foggy Dog's Upcycled Denim collection. For this collection, they partnered with The New Denim Project, a family-operated Guatemalan textile mill that rescues fabrics from nearby factories that would otherwise go to waste and turns them into something new using a chemical and dye-free process that requires very little water and power. This collection has conserved 320 million liters of water, prevented the release of 3,300 pounds of toxic chemicals, and avoided 32,000 pounds of carbon dioxide output. Each toy is stuffed with Sustainafill™, an eco-friendly fiber made from recycled plastic bottles. While a dog toy is almost never indestructible, Foggy Dog is given high praise on durability, and they use heavy-duty squeakers that keep going even when punctured.",
