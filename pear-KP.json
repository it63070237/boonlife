        "description": "A water bottle - or a flask - that celebrates and protects the planet. Boon loves this Insulated Stainless Steel Bottle with Topographic Print. Designed for making and drinking coffee, tea, cocktails, and more, every detail is considered—from the freezable steel core that keeps drink cold without diluting (while also doubling as a muddle for cocktail making) to the electropolish interior finish that protects against the transfer of taste, smell, and mold. And it's made by Hibear, a fellow Climate Neutral brand who cares about the planet—and zero waste lifestyles—as much as Boon does. This bottle was designed to represent the Seven Summits—the highest mountains on each continent—and features artwork by Lauren Ouye, who draws inspiration from the topographic maps she studied while hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.",
