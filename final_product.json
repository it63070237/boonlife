Designed for making and drinking coffee, tea, cocktails, and more, every detail is considered—from the freezable steel core that keeps drink cold without diluting (while also doubling as a muddle for cocktail making) to the electropolish interior finish that protects against the transfer of taste, smell, and mold. And it's made by Hibear, a fellow Climate Neutral brand who cares about the planet—and zero waste lifestyles—as much as Boon does. This bottle was designed to represent the Seven Summits—the highest mountains on each continent—and features artwork by Lauren Ouye, who draws inspiration from the topographic maps she studied while hiking in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.",

Both sides of the Autumnal Plaid Flannel Bow Tie Dog Dog Collar are cozy cotton flannel, which is great for dogs prone to chafing or allergic reactions. The bow tie is secured by elastic loops and easily removable from your dog's more casual outings. Choose the small bow for a more traditional look, or the large for a bolder fashion statement. The fall-colored shades of mustard, burnt orange, cream, and slate are complemented by gold tone hardware. Hobie, a 29-pound beagle and very good boy, is wearing a Medium collar with Large bow tie.",

This collection has conserved 320 million liters of water, prevented the release of 3,300 pounds of toxic chemicals, and avoided 32,000 pounds of carbon dioxide output.
