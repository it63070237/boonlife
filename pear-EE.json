The Eco-friendly Round Rattan Backpack looks natural and supports the health of our planet. Rattan is incredibly sustainable, it's the fastest-growing tropical wood and preserves the rainforest's natural balance while converting carbon dioxide to oxygen. The techniques used to turn raw rattan wood into furniture and accessories have been passed down for generations, relying on handicraft rather than pollution-heavy manufacturing processes. Rattan's strength and resiliency will hold up well to normal wear and tear, reducing waste by lengthening the life of your bag. Each bag features an iron button closure and is lined in batik print fabric.",
